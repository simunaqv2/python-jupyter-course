    "In a pie chart:\n",
    "- The whole circle represents 100% of the data\n",
    "- Each slice shows what percentage that category contributes\n",
    "- Larger slices = larger portions of the whole\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Pie Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie charts work best when:\n",
    "- You want to show **parts of a whole** (percentages that add up to 100%)\n",
    "- You have a **small number of categories** (ideally 2-6)\n",
